\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{chap:acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr.\ Jacques Carette.
Through his invested time, effort, and guidance, I was able to grow as a
researcher, explore my ideas, and learn more than I could have hoped.
Additionally, I would like to Dr.\ Spencer Smith for the encouraging discourse,
feedback, and advice in our Drasil meetings. Furthermore, I would like to thank
Dr.\ Wolfram Kahl for his advice and feedback on my work, and Dong Chen for his
help with editing my thesis. Thanks to my parents Yakup and Christina, my
brother Daniel, and my aunt Leila for their endless love and support of me while
I continue my education. Thanks to my friends for always being there for me. In
particular, I would like to thank Hala for her support and encouragement
throughout this process. 

Finally, I would also like to thank the Drasil research team present and past
for the memories and fruitful discussion.

I could not have done this without any one of you.
